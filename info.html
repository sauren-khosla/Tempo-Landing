        Hi. <br/> <br/>
        We're Kush & Sauren Khosla, two brothers who believe that modern social media platforms are contributing to a mental health crisis and no longer serve their main purpose of connecting people. <br/> <br/>
        These platforms now isolate people more than ever and drive users to fixate on influencers and quantity over quality. We firmly believe that social networks should bolster existing connections and help users create new, genuine friendships, rather than fostering inauthentic presentations of life. <br/> <br/>
        That's where Tempo comes in. Tempo is designed to help you: <br/>
        <br/>
        - Cherish shared memories with multiple people, creating a collaborative timeline of your favorite moments. <br/>
        - Discover and join events tailored to your interests, while connecting with like-minded individuals in a more intimate setting. <br/>
        - Expand your social circle through personalized introductions from mutual friends, fostering genuine connections. <br/>
        <br/>
        In particular, you'll need someone's phone number to add them on the app! With Tempo, you can connect with the people you care about most and forge new friendships, all at your own tempo. <br/> <br/>
        Thanks for reading and we hope that you enjoy using Tempo! Please feel free to reach out if you have comments, ideas, or questions. Weâ€™ll be working tirelessly to act on your feedback. <br/> <br/>
        Kush & Sauren <br/>
